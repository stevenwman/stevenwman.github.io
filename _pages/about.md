<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, I am a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute working with Prof. [Aaron Johnson](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/johnson-aaron.html) and Prof. [Sarah Bergbreiter](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/bergbreiter-sarah.html). My research interests lie in the intersection of design and control for novel robot locomotion. I'm fortunate to be supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). 

Priror to joining CMU, I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I worked with Prof. [Elliot Hawkes](https://www.hawkeslab.com/) on [everting soft robots for industrial inspection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10758775) and [shape-changing robotic collectives](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads7942). I have also spent summers working at [JHUAPL](https://www.jhuapl.edu/), [CMU RISS](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/), and [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/).
